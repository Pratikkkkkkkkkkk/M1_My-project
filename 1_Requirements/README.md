INTRODUCTION :

This is a mini project on "Scientific Calculator" which is basically used for various types of scientific calculations.
I am implementing various operations in this mini project and this project  is very helpful for everyone especially 
students and working professionals who want a calculator to perform calculations and research.
Scientific calculator's basic functions are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division , modulus , power and factorial calculations.


ANALYSIS :
1. Strengths
* The biggest strength of this calculator is that it calculates normal integer and floating point values.
2. Weakness
* Matrix calculations are not implemented.
* There is no memory feature available to remember past calculations.
3. Oportunities
* It provides an opportunity to perform simple and complex(difficult) calculations with ease and accuracy.
4. Threats
* A Major threat is lack of memory and smart features in the calculator.
* Security of data in calculations.

Who?
The scientific calculator is for anyone who want to perform simple and scientific calcuations.
What?
This calculator calculates expressions entered by the user and gives the desired results.
When?
This calculator can be used when we want to do calculations.
Where?
It can be used in homes, schools, colleges, offices. Basically it can be used anywhere where a calculator is required.
How?
It asks the user for the mode of calculation. That is it asks if it wants to do simle calculations, or if it wants to do vector arithmetic or complex number calculation. Based on the user choice, it asks what operation it wants to perform. Based on the user choice, it asks for the user input and calculates the output.
