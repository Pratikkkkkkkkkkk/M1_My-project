INTRODUCTION

The mini porject which I am going to implement is a scientific calculator.
A scientific calculator is used to do scientific calculations.
I am implementing complex and vector functions in my mini project
This priject is very helpful for students and working professionals who want a calculator to perform calculations.
RESEARCH
Scientific calculator
Calculate basic functions like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
Also has modulus and factorial calculations.
It has two modes - Complex and vector mode.
Complex mode is used for calculations involving complex numbers.
Vector mode is used to operate with vectors.
SWOT ANALYSIS
1. Strengths
* The biggest strength of this calculator is that it calculates normal integer and floating point values with precision upto 7 Decimal places.
* It also performs complex operations with greater accuracy.
* Vector operations are also performed.
2. Weakness
* Matrix calculations are not implemented.
* There is no memory feature available to remember past calculations.
3. Oportunities
* It provides an opportunity to perform simple and complex(difficult) calculations with ease and accuracy.
4. Threats
* A Major threat is lack of memory and smart features in the calculator.
* Security of data in calculations.

Who?
The scientific calculator is for anyone who want to perform simple and scientific calcuations.
What?
This calculator calculates expressions entered by the user and gives the desired results.
When?
This calculator can be used when we want to do calculations.
Where?
It can be used in homes, schools, colleges, offices. Basically it can be used anywhere where a calculator is required.
How?
It asks the user for the mode of calculation. That is it asks if it wants to do simle calculations, or if it wants to do vector arithmetic or complex number calculation. Based on the user choice, it asks what operation it wants to perform. Based on the user choice, it asks for the user input and calculates the output.
